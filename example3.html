        <main><h3>Discription</h3>
        <p>My name is Begari Rahul, a highly motivated and adaptable individual with a strong foundation in both technical and managerial roles. I hold a B.Tech degree from Anurag University and have developed solid skills in Python, Java, and Microsoft SQL Server. My passion for learning and technology has led me to work on diverse projects, including vehicle health monitoring systems using IoT, plant leaf disease detection using machine learning, and an ATM simulation project. With over 3 years of experience as a Sales Manager, I’ve honed my leadership, client relationship, and target management skills. I’m now eager to transition into a tech-focused role, particularly in software development or DevOps, and am constantly upskilling through certifications and hands-on projects. I am fluent in English, Telugu, and Hindi, and bring with me strong communication skills and a drive to grow in the dynamic tech industry</p>
